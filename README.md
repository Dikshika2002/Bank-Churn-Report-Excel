# Bank-Churn-Report-Excel
In this analysis, the goal is to gain insights into bank customer behavior and determine the factors that contribute to customer churn using Excel's Pivot Tables and Data Analysis ToolPak. The analysis focuses on answering key questions such as:

The average credit score for different geographies.
Variation in average account balance between genders within each country.
Distribution of active versus non-active members based on credit card ownership.
Customer churn rate per number of products used.
Comparison of average credit scores for customers who exited versus those who stayed, across different tenures.
Additionally, the research investigates whether there is a significant difference in:

Average earnings between churned and non-churned customers.
Average credit scores across different geographic locations.
The assignment also involves handling missing or inconsistent data in the "EstimatedSalary" and "Balance" variables, using average values to correct them. The findings are presented through separate Pivot Tables and statistical analysis for each question, providing a clear understanding of customer churn factors.
